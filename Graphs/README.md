# Graphs

### What are Graphs  

Graphs are a set of values related in a pair-wise fashion. It is a network of nodes connected by edges. Graphs are data structures used to model real-world relationships.  

There are different types of Graphs:  
  - Directed vs. Undirected, the difference between directed and undirected graphs is the flow of direction between nodes. Much like the Facebook Friends social network system vs. an Instagram Followers social network system.  
  - Weight vs. Unweighted, the difference between weighted and unweighted graphs is that in a weighted graph the edges hold values. For example, Google Maps utilizes weighted graphs to find the optimal route to a destination among its multiple routes.  
  - Cyclic vs. Acyclic, in a cyclic graph the nodes are connected in a circular fashion. Cyclic Graphs are commonly found in weighted graphs such as Google Maps where for a given destination, there will be a return destination.
